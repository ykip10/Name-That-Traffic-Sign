# Name-That-Traffic-Sign
Leverages machine learning methods to classify traffic signs based on images from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. In this project, we use a training dataset from GTSRB to train our models, then use a disjoint test set provided by Kaggle to evaluate performance. 

python libraries:
pandas, numpy, sklearn, paddleocr, PIL, skimage, cv2, easyocr,
matplotlib, seaborn, pytorch

To regenerate the results of the models on the Kaggle dataset, just run all the code in the code.ipynb notebook. The models run purely on training data (with confusion matrices and robust evaluation metrics used in the report) are under "Model Fitting and Evaluations".
